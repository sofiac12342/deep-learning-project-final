# Data directories for ML Skill Video Ranking

## Structure

- `raw/`: Optional directory for storing raw API responses (not currently used)
- `processed/`: CSV files generated by the data acquisition pipeline

## Generated Files (in processed/)

After running the acquisition pipeline, you'll find:

1. **video_skill_candidates.csv**: All (video_id, skill_id) pairs collected from search queries
2. **videos_raw.csv**: Raw video metadata before filtering
3. **transcripts_raw.csv**: Raw transcript data before filtering
4. **videos_filtered.csv**: Video metadata after quality filters
5. **transcripts_filtered.csv**: Transcript data after quality filters

All files include a `batch_id` column for tracking different data collection runs.
