2,"Defines the network architecture and layer terminology. While relevant to Neural Networks in general, it describes the conceptual structure rather than the `nn.Module` or `nn.Linear` implementation in PyTorch.",2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,w8yWXqWQYmU,pytorch_neural_networks
3,"Explains the mathematical necessity of activation functions (avoiding collapsing into linear regression). This provides high technical depth on the 'underlying mechanics' of NNs, which is excellent theory, but still lacks PyTorch specificity.",2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,w8yWXqWQYmU,pytorch_neural_networks
4,"Explains the ReLU activation function. This is a theoretical concept used in PyTorch (`F.relu`), but the explanation is mathematical/conceptual, not applied PyTorch code.",2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,w8yWXqWQYmU,pytorch_neural_networks
5,"Explains Softmax and probability outputs. High conceptual value for understanding classification heads in PyTorch, but remains tool-agnostic theory.",2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,w8yWXqWQYmU,pytorch_neural_networks
6,"Introduces Backpropagation and error calculation. This explains the logic that PyTorch's autograd handles automatically. Useful for theory, but tangential to learning the PyTorch API.",2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,w8yWXqWQYmU,pytorch_neural_networks
7,A very short fragment defining a derivative variable. Contains minimal standalone information.,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,w8yWXqWQYmU,pytorch_neural_networks
8,"Details the math behind backpropagation gradients. This is 'Expert' level depth regarding what happens under the hood, but since the user wants to learn PyTorch (which abstracts this away), it is theoretical background rather than the target skill.",2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,w8yWXqWQYmU,pytorch_neural_networks
9,"Shows the parameter update equations and begins coding. However, the imports are `numpy` and `pandas`, confirming the tutorial is not in PyTorch. The coding example is for a NumPy implementation.",2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,w8yWXqWQYmU,pytorch_neural_networks
0,"This chunk is primarily introductory context. It defines the problem (missing data/spam) and performs library imports and dummy data setup. While necessary for the tutorial, it does not yet teach the specific data cleaning syntax or techniques.",2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,wUuILD-3VJU,pandas_data_cleaning
1,"The speaker creates a Series with missing values and uses analogies (weather, stock) to explain the concept. It identifies the missing data but cuts off before demonstrating the actual cleaning code.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,wUuILD-3VJU,pandas_data_cleaning
2,Directly demonstrates the `dropna()` function on both a Series and a DataFrame. It explains the default behavior (dropping rows with *any* missing values). This is core content for the skill.,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,wUuILD-3VJU,pandas_data_cleaning
3,"Explains the `how='all'` parameter in detail. This adds depth by showing how to customize the cleaning logic to only drop rows where every value is missing, rather than the default behavior.",5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,wUuILD-3VJU,pandas_data_cleaning
4,Demonstrates cleaning data column-wise using `axis=1`. It attempts to combine this with the `how='all'` parameter. This is highly relevant as it covers structural data cleaning variations.,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,wUuILD-3VJU,pandas_data_cleaning
5,This chunk is a conceptual bridge explaining the logic of threshold-based filtering before applying it. It discusses the limitations of previous methods (all vs any) and introduces the need for `thresh`. The verbal explanation is a bit wordy/run-on.,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,wUuILD-3VJU,pandas_data_cleaning
6,"Successfully demonstrates the `thresh` parameter with code, showing how to keep rows based on a minimum count of non-NA values. The speaker walks through the specific rows preserved to verify the logic.",5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,wUuILD-3VJU,pandas_data_cleaning
7,"This is the video outro. It mentions that the next video will cover filling/imputation (another cleaning technique), but this specific chunk contains no educational content.",1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,wUuILD-3VJU,pandas_data_cleaning
10,"This chunk provides a strong conceptual overview of CNN architecture, specifically explaining pooling, data augmentation, and the flow of layers (Convolution -> ReLU -> Pooling). While it does not show TensorFlow code, it covers the logic required to build the networks described in the skill. The explanation of why pooling is used (dimension reduction) and how augmentation handles rotation adds depth.",4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,zfiSAzpy9NM,tensorflow_image_classification
11,"The beginning of the chunk touches on backpropagation and hyperparameters (filter size/count), which is relevant theory. However, the majority of the chunk transitions into a channel introduction, self-promotion, and playlist overview. This dilutes the technical value significantly, making it mostly tangential context.",2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,zfiSAzpy9NM,tensorflow_image_classification
12,This chunk is purely a call to action for comments/feedback. It contains no educational content related to TensorFlow or image classification.,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,zfiSAzpy9NM,tensorflow_image_classification
