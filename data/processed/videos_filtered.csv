lLRBYKwP8GQ,Ultimate Guide to NumPy Arrays - VERY DETAILED TUTORIAL for beginners!,"In this tutorial, we will learn about NumPy arrays in great detail! 🤓 
NumPy is one of the most popular Python libraries and just as it sounds - it deals with numbers! 
An array, on the other hand,  is a collection of items of the same type and it's the data structure that NumPy uses.
This video will give you the tools and demos to understand how NumPy manages data and how it approaches memory consumption. 

We will explore different functions and methods to:
⭐ create N-dimensional arrays
⭐ reshape arrays
⭐ sort arrays with different algorithms
⭐ filter and manipulate array values

The goal of this Ultimate Guide (and all the future Ultimate Guides I'll be filming for other libraries) - is to cover a HUGE part of the NumPy documentation. It's meant for all the folks who learn by example rather than by reading dry text and hopefully this will take your NumPy skills to an expert level! 🥼🥼🥼

In this lecture we are discussing about:

-- Ways of creating arrays in numpy: 
   we have 6 way of creating arrays in numpy
    a)array()
    b)linspace()
    c)arange()
    d)logspace()
    e)zeros()
    f)ones()

from numpy import * 
arr =array([1,2,3,4,5])
print(arr) 
print(arr.dtype) # int32

arr =array([1,2,3,4,5.0])
print(arr.dtype) # float
-- automatically it will convert the data type to float

arr =array([1,2,3,4,5],float)
print(arr.dtype) # float 
-- we can also specify the data type of array 

b) linspace() 
-- it is used to create an array with equal interval between the elements 
-- syntax: linspace(start,stop,num=50,endpoint=True,retstep=False,dtype=None)
arr=linspace(0,15,16) # here it break the range into 16 equal parts 
-- by default it will take 50 parts 

arr =linspace(0,15)
print(arr)

c) arange()
-- it is used to create an array with equal interval between the elements
-- syntax: arange(start,stop,step,dtype=None) 
arr =arange(1,15,2)
print(arr) 
-- it will create an array with start value 1 and end value 15 with step size 2
arr=arange(1,15,2.5)

d) logspace()
-- it is used to create an array with equal interval between the elements in log scale
-- syntax: logspace(start,stop,num=50,endpoint=True,base=10.0,dtype=None) 
arr=logspace(1,40,5)
print(arr) 

e) zeros()
-- it is used to create an array with all zeros 
-- syntax: zeros(shape,dtype=float,order='C') 
arr= zeros(5)
print(arr)


f) ones()
-- it is used to create an array with all ones 
-- syntax: ones(shape,dtype=float,order='C')
arr=ones(5)
print(arr)

# if i want work with int
arr=ones(4,int)
print(arr)

Watch the full video of Shashank: https://youtu.be/pKvWD0f18Pc

Python is amazing for data science… but using it to clean data is like using a chainsaw to cut a birthday cake! 

In this popular YouTube tutorial by @ShashankData, that’s been viewed over 3.5 million times, he shows how to clean SurveyMonkey data using Python and Pandas. This is a real job he did for a client which took him 1 hour.  

And to be clear, Shashank does everything correctly! His process is solid, and he’s great at explaining it. But here’s the thing… 

There’s a much faster way to do this. A way that’s fully automated, 100% repeatable, and requires zero coding. And many data analysts don’t realize it’s possible. 

Power Query in Excel can do the same transformation in just 5 minutes. No scripting, no debugging, just a simple, efficient process that anyone can use. 

In this video, I’ll show you how to clean the same dataset 12x faster, so you can work smarter, not harder, and even outbid Python pros for jobs like this!

EeWMidT9JMs,6. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing in Pandas (Quick Quiz Included!),"In this video, you will learn the essential steps to transform messy raw data into a reliable foundation for analysis. Using Pandas (and the Pandas Profiling add-on), you will learn how to detect and fix missing values, remove duplicates, generate automated exploratory reports, and summarise key statistics.

*📝 What You Will Learn*

* Detect missing values with *isna()/isnull()* and count them with *.sum().*
* Apply practical imputation strategies: *dropna()* to remove and *fillna()* for mean, median, max, or min replacement.
* Identify and handle duplicate rows with *duplicated(),* including single-column and multi-column checks.
* Generate a full *Pandas Profiling* report to automate exploratory data analysis and reveal distributions, correlations, and outliers.
* Produce quick *descriptive statistics* with *.describe()* for both numeric and categorical data.
* Analyse *frequency distributions* using *.value_counts()* and percentages *(normalize = True)* , then sort results for insight.

uDr67HBIPz8,Handling Missing Values in Pandas Dataframe | GeeksforGeeks,"In this video, we're going to discuss how to handle missing values in Pandas. In Pandas DataFrame sometimes many datasets simply arrive with missing data, either because it exists and was not collected or it never existed. And as we can't provide null values to our Machine Learning model, we need to handle them properly. Now, let's get started. 

00:00 Let's Start
01:44 Checking for Missing Values using isnull()
03:31 Filling Null Values Using fillna()
05:35 Filling Null Values Using fillna(method = 'pad')
07:05 Filling Null Values Using fillna(method = 'bfill')
11:41 Filling Null Values with the Mean, Max or Min of a Column
13:38 Dropping Null Values Using dropna()
16:12 Filling Null Values Using replace()
18:47 Filling Null Values Using interpolate()

🔹 Easy Method to Fill Missing Data with a meaningful value instead of Dropping


And depending on the data type depending on the situation, you might want to take one or more of these approaches to fill in the missing data, for instance, are very commonly used approaches filling the missing data with zero, when would you use this suppose if the column that you are trying to fill in is fair, right and you and you are noticing some missing values, in fact, it could be possible that that person did not pay anything to get on board. 

For example, for Titanic data of the fair value is not present if it is missing, it could be possible the person did not pay anything in such case, it would be meaningful to replace that field or that cell with zero.

Likewise, if it is a categorical data, very usual approach to do is fill in the missing with the most frequently occurring data, especially if in your categorical data if one particular category is occurring a lot of time you know if it is dominating your categorical column, then taking this approach is more meaningful. 

Alternately, for numeric data taking the mean or a median is a very, very common approach this is the most common approach Alright, for sequential data, you have a data that is having a sequence definite sequence to it that is one data point occurs after another in a certain sequence.

Backward fill means you are filling it with the next occurring value that is backward fill interpolation is in case of sequential or order data, you can interpolate a value that is missing in between.

E1_pHKOfUxA,Handling Missing Data (Data Cleaning) - Pandas | Python ~ Episode 6,"Hey Coders! As much as we dream of a perfect world, when it comes to raw data found out in the wild, it will most likely be patchy. Missing data is one of the most prevalent causes of data cleaning. Sometimes, non-existent data is OK, but for those other times, pandas provides a suite of methods and techniques to resolve missing values. Some examples are dropping the row altogether, or a more gentle approach, of filling in those missing vales with another value. One example could be filling in missing numbers within a column of numbers with the average of the numbers already there. That way, recalculating the average won't change the outcome.

QVJY4qJ5-YE,Python Pandas Tutorial - Handling Missing Data Using Pandas,"Welcome back to week 5 of Pandas Zero to Hero, a video series where I teach beginner-friendly ways of using pandas that will take your data analysis to the next level.

In this tutorial, I cover the concept of data types as well as how to deal with missing data using pandas. Missing data is one of the most common problems that you will face in almost all data science projects. Therefore, it is important that you not only know how to detect those missing data in your dataset but also the techniques to properly handle them.

There are mainly two ways to deal with missing data. The easiest and most straightforward one is by dropping rows or columns that contain missing data. However, in doing so, we run into the risk of removing potentially useful information and features from our data frame that will negatively impact our model and the predictions made by our model. Alternatively, we can use a method called imputation which is essentially filling our missing data with some substituted values. Although this is the more preferable way to handle missing data, the process of imputation does require more time, consideration and experience.

I hope you will find my tutorial helpful in your learning. Stay tuned for my tutorial next week where we will learn about combining data frames using pandas functions, concat and merge. 

It would mean a lot to me if you could drop a like on the video and subscribe to my channel. It will greatly help the channel grow and help more people who are also learning data science.

With that said, keep learning and I can't wait to see you in my next tutorial.

Yay finally posting again. Hopefully this video will help you get comfortable working through the matplotlib library. I'm going to post a follow up video with real-world examples (combining pandas with matplotlib) and different types of plots next week. I originally was going to include that in this one, but I thought the video was getting a bit too long.

In this video we walk through some of the basics of matplotlib. We start by making a simple line graph. We learn how to give the graph a title and label the x & y axis. We learn how to scale the graph by specifying the x & y tickmarks. After this, we restyle our line by passing in keyword arguments then do basically the same thing with a shorthand notation. We resize our graph and save it. Then we end with a simple bar chart.

https://stratascratch.com/?via=keith

In this video, we go through several real-world examples of using the Matplotlib & Pandas libraries to visualize data from CSV files. This is a follow-up to my introductory matplotlib video (https://youtu.be/DAQNHzOcO5A). Timeline for what we cover can be found in the comments. 

We start by creating line graphs of global gas price data over time. We review how to add a title, x & y axis labels, and scale our graph. We review how to customize the style and size of our charts. Next, we look at the FIFA 19 player data to create a histogram, a couple pie charts, and a box and whisker plot.

q7Bo_J8x_dw,Matplotlib Tutorial 1 - Introduction and Line,"Welcome to a Matplotlib with Python 3+ tutorial series. In this series, we're going to be covering most aspects to the Matplotlib data visualization module. Matplotlib is capable of creating most kinds of charts, like line graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, stack plots, 3D graphs, and geographic map graphs.

First, in order to actually use Matplotlib, we're going to need it!

If you have a later version of Python installed, you should be able to open cmd.exe/terminal and then run:

pip install matplotlib

Note: You may need to do C:/Python34/Scripts/pip install matplotlib if the above shorter version doesn't work.

Hello and welcome to this course on data visualization with Matplotlib!

A picture is worth a thousand words. Data visualizations let you derive insights from data and let you communicate about the data with others.

 For example, this visualization shows an animated history of an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. The amount of information in this complex visualization is simply staggering!

This visualization was created using Matplotlib, a Python library that is widely used to visualize data. There are many software libraries that visualize data. One of the main advantages of Matplotlib is that it gives you complete control over the properties of your plot. This allows you to customize and control the precise properties of your visualizations.

At the end of this course, you will know not only how to control your visualizations, but also how to create programs that automatically create visualizations based on your data.

 There are many different ways to use Matplotlib. In this course, we will use the main object-oriented interface. This interface is provided through the pyplot submodule. Here, we import this submodule and name it plt. While using the name plt is not necessary for the program to work, this is a very strongly-followed convention, and we will follow it here as well.

The plt-dot-subplots command, when called without any inputs, creates two different objects: a Figure object and an Axes object. 

The Figure object is a container that holds everything that you see on the page. 

Meanwhile, the Axes is the part of the page that holds the data. It is the canvas on which we will draw with our data, to visualize it. 

Here, you can see a Figure with empty Axes. No data has been added yet.

 Let's add some data to our figure. Here is some data. This is a DataFrame that contains information about the weather in the city of Seattle in the different months of the year. 

The ""MONTH"" column contains the three-letter names of the months of the year.

The ""monthly average normal temperature"" column contains the temperatures in these months, in Fahrenheit degrees, averaged over a ten-year period.

 To add the data to the Axes, we call a plotting command. The plotting commands are methods of the Axes object. For example, here we call the method called plot with the month column as the first argument and the temperature column as the second argument. Finally, we call the plt-dot-show function to show the effect of the plotting command.

This adds a line to the plot. The horizontal dimension of the plot represents the months according to their order and the height of the line at each month represents the average temperature. The trends in the data are now much clearer than they were just by reading off the temperatures from the table.

 If you want, you can add more data to the plot. For example, we also have a table that stores data about the average temperatures in the city of Austin, Texas. 

We add these data to the axes by calling the plot method again.

 Here is what all of the code to create this figure would then look like. First, we create the Figure and the Axes objects. We call the Axes method plot to add first the Seattle temperatures, and then the Austin temperatures to the Axes. Finally, we ask Matplotlib to show us the figure.

 Now it's your turn. In the exercises, you will practice making a figure and axes and adding data into them.

r-uOLxNrNk8,"Data Analysis with Python - Full Course for Beginners (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)","Learn Data Analysis with Python in this comprehensive tutorial for beginners, with exercises included!
NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

hDKCxebp88A,Machine Learning with Python and Scikit-Learn – Full Course,"This course is a practical and hands-on introduction to Machine Learning with Python and Scikit-Learn for beginners with basic knowledge of Python and statistics.

It is designed and taught by Aakash N S, CEO and co-founder of Jovian. Check out their YouTube channel here: https://youtube.com/@jovianhq

We'll start with the basics of machine learning by exploring models like linear & logistic regression and then move on to tree-based models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosting machines. We'll also discuss best practices for approaching and managing machine learning projects and build a state-of-the-art machine learning model for a real-world dataset from scratch. We'll also look at unsupervised learning & recommendations briefly and walk through the process of deploying a machine-learning model to the cloud using the Flask web framework.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to confidently build, train, and deploy machine learning models in the real world. To get the most out of this course, follow along & type out all the code yourself, and apply the techniques covered here to other real-world datasets & competitions that you can find on platforms like Kaggle.

RlQuVL6-qe8,Training a machine learning model with scikit-learn,"Now that we're familiar with the famous iris dataset, let's actually use a classification model in scikit-learn to predict the species of an iris! We'll learn how the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model works, and then walk through the four steps for model training and prediction in scikit-learn. Finally, we'll see how easy it is to try out a different classification model, namely logistic regression.

Original Tutorial: https://www.jcchouinard.com/classification-report-in-scikit-learn/

## What is a Classification Report

A Classification Report is used to compute the accuracy of a classification model based on the values from the confusion matrix. 

### Sklearn `classification_report()`

In Scikit-learn, `classification_report()` function from `sklearn.metrics` module is used to return a classification report.

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

linear regression python sklearn. In this video we will learn how to use SkLearn for linear regression in Python. You can follow along with this linear regression sklearn python example. The linear regression in python will be done using SKlearn. The first thing we need to do is import. We will import a pydataset to use in this example. And let’s get Pandas and numpy. Next we import the thing we will need from sklearn. LinearRegression from the linear_model package, train test split, and lastly let’s get matplotlib in there so we can visualize this model. First of all, let’s get our data. We will be using the Pima women data. If you ever want to see details about a dataset you can enter in the keyword. Let’s check this data to see if it is approximately linear. In this example we will see if tricep skin fold measurements can predict body mass index (BMI). We can use the pandas plotting capabilities, with kind as scatter. There is the plot. This looks decently linear. So we will proceed with the model. Now we are going to do a test train split. We are doing supervised learning. Basically we create the model using only the training data, and then we use that model to see how well it predicts the testing data. Let’s plot the train test split so you can see what I mean. Everything in red will be used to create our line, and that line will be tested against the green data. Okay, so now let’s actually create the linear mode. LR.fit() and we will plug in X_train and y_train.  We reshape X_train because the input must be two dimensional. So .reshape(-1,1) will work just fine. Now let’s use this model to predict on the test data. We will plot that against a scatter plot of the actual test data. Here it is. The line is the model prediction and the green points are the actual data. It seems to do a decent job at following the overall trend. There may be some outliers.  Suppose we want to see how the model will predict a specific skin fold measurement, say 50. Let’s plug that in and see. Alright, now we will score the model using Sklearn’s built-in score function. and it came out at .39… The max it could get would be a 1. I want you to think about what that score means and leave what you think in the comments below. Do you think this is a good model?  So there you have it, that is how you can use python’s Sklearn to create a linear regression model.

VqKq78PVO9g,"Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 17: L1 and L2 Regularization | Lasso, Ridge Regression","In this Python machine learning tutorial for beginners, we will look into,
1) What is overfitting, underfitting
2) How to address overfitting using L1 and L2 regularization
3) Write code in Python and sklearn for housing price prediction where we will see a model overfit when we use simple linear regression. Then we will use Lasso regression (L1 regularization) and ridge regression (L2 regression) to address this overfitting issue

MswxJw-8PvE,PyTorch Autograd Explained - In-depth Tutorial,"In this PyTorch tutorial, I explain how the PyTorch autograd system works by going through some examples and visualize the graphs with diagrams. As you perform operations on PyTorch tensors that have requires_grad=True, you build up an autograd backward graph. Then when you call the backward() method on one of the output nodes, the backward graph gets traversed, starting at the node that the grad_fn attribute of the output node points to, and traversing backwards from there, accumulating gradients until leaf nodes are reached. The final leaf node gradients will be stored on the grad attribute of the leaf tensors.

This is my first PyTorch tutorial video. If you'd like to see more PyTorch related videos, let me know in the comments. And if you have anything specific about PyTorch that you would like me to make videos about, let me know.

""Building a Neural Network from Scratch: A Journey into Pure Math and Code""

But beneath the surface of AI that feels like magic, lies elegant mathematics and careful coding. For those of us who love peeling back the layers, there's something incredibly satisfying about building a neural network from scratch—not using PyTorch or TensorFlow packages, but with nothing but pure mathematics.

If you have ever wanted to fully understand deep neural networks, this is your opportunity. I have created a 1-hour video on Vizuara’s YouTube channel, where we will understand and implement a neural network step-by-step.

The Breakdown of the Video

First 30 Minutes: Theory and Math
This segment dives deep into the equations and logic behind neural networks. Whether it’s calculating the gradients or dissecting the role of the loss function, you’ll understand the ""why"" behind every concept.

1) We start with the fundamentals—no shortcuts, no pre-built libraries. 
2) Problem statement and dataset
3) Defining the neural network architecture by hand
3) Setting up forward propagation
4) What exactly is backpropagation, and why is it so central to deep learning?
5) Setting up the mathematical equations for gradient descent.


Next 30 Minutes: Coding in Python
Once we have laid the theoretical foundation, we move to implementation. Here, you will see every line of code written from scratch—initializing weights, performing forward and backward passes, and updating the parameters using gradient descent. NumPy serves as our toolkit, allowing us to manipulate arrays and matrices while staying close to the mathematical essence of neural networks.

You will definitely get a high if your from scratch code works and you see that you are able to make good predictions on the dataset. 

In a world where high-level libraries handle the heavy lifting, you might wonder, “Why bother with the hard way? I can do all of this in 10 lines of code.” Here’s why:

1) Deep understanding: Pre-built frameworks are powerful but abstract. Writing your own neural network forces you to understand how each component works together.

2) Debugging: When something goes wrong in a complex model, having a firm grasp of the fundamentals can save hours of frustration.

3) Foundational skills: Learning to code from scratch builds confidence and lays a solid foundation for more advanced topics like custom layers, optimizers, and model architectures.

This lecture is perfect for anyone curious about AI and machine learning—whether you are just starting out or looking to strengthen your foundational knowledge. You don’t need an extensive math background, just a willingness to learn and follow along.

If this sounds like something you would enjoy, check out the full video on Vizuara’s YouTube channel. By the end, you will have your very own neural network running—not because a library did it for you, but because you built it with your own hands.

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen that introduces neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation to Nielsen if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data, which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduced in this video.  Yay for active learning!

In episode one, we showed a scenario of rock, paper, and scissors; and discussed how difficult it might be to write code to detect and classify these. As the episodes have progressed into machine learning, we’ve learned how to build neural networks from detecting patterns in raw pixels, to classifying them, to detecting features using convolutions. In this episode, we have put all the information from the first three parts of the series into one.

NtFzp48AgBo,Going further with Image Classification,"Previously you saw how to build an Android or iOS app that could read the contents of an image, recognizing several hundred types of item. It had a limitation in that it did poorly at recognizing specific types of objects. So, for example, a picture of a flower might be recognized as a flower, but not as a daisy, a rose, or a tulip. In this video you’ll learn how to create a custom model to recognize those flower types, and then update your app with just a few lines of code!

EvE0xT36kO0,Image classification using Tensorflow and CNN | Basic Deep Learning,"It is a Deep Learning Project for beginners - How would you classify images using CNN. This Python code is an example of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
Let's code step-by-step:
Data Loading and Exploration: The code starts by importing necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, the Keras API, and NumPy for numerical operations and matplotlib for visualization.
The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using datasets.cifar10.load_data() function. It is divided into training and test sets, each containing images and corresponding labels (10 classes).
The shapes of the training and test sets are printed to check the number of samples and dimensions of the images.

Data Preprocessing: The code normalizes the pixel values of the images from the range [0, 255] to [0, 1] by dividing each pixel value by 255. This step is essential for efficient training of neural networks. The labels in y_train and y_test are initially in a 2D shape. They are reshaped to be 1D arrays using y_train.reshape(-1,). This step is necessary for the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function used later. The function plot_sample() is defined to visualize a sample image from the dataset along with its corresponding class label. This function takes the dataset, labels, and the index of the sample to be visualized.

The first neural network (ann) is built using Keras' Sequential API. It starts with a Flatten layer that converts the 32x32x3 input images into a flat vector. It follows with two dense (fully connected) layers with 3000 and 1000 units, respectively. The activation function used is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which introduces non-linearity in the network. The final dense layer has 10 units (equal to the number of classes) and uses the softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each class. The model is compiled using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. The model is then trained on the training set (X_train and y_train) for 5 epochs.

The model is compiled using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
The model is then trained on the training set (X_train and y_train) for 5 epochs.
The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using the test set (X_test and y_test) using the classification_report from scikit-learn. The second neural network (cnn) is constructed for image classification using CNN architecture. It starts with a Conv2D layer with 32 filters (kernels) of size 3x3, followed by a ReLU activation function. A MaxPooling2D layer with a pool size of 2x2 is added to downsample the feature maps. The process is repeated with another Conv2D layer with 64 filters and a ReLU activation, followed by a MaxPooling2D layer. The feature maps are then flattened to a 1D vector using the Flatten layer. Two dense layers with 64 and 10 units, respectively, are added with ReLU and softmax activations for classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
The CNN model (cnn) is trained on the normalized training set (X_train and y_train) for 10 epochs.
The accuracy of the CNN model is evaluated using the test set (X_test and y_test) using cnn.evaluate(). The model's predictions (y_pred) are obtained on the test set, and the class with the highest probability for each sample is extracted as the predicted class.
A sample image from the test set with its true class and predicted class is visualized using plot_sample() classes.
Lastly, it prints the class name for the predicted class of the seventh sample in the test set.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate two different neural network architectures for image classification: a basic neural network and a convolutional neural network. 
The CNN achieves better performance than the basic neural network due to its ability to learn hierarchical features from images.

FEMDZWXfdSE,Tensorflow image recognition,"Introduction to Tensorflow. 

Building Image recognition model using Keras

We will start with a brief overview of machine learning and supervised machine learning. Then we will talk about Tensorflow and Keras libraries and setup a local environment to work with them using Anaconda. And finally we’ll build our first Convolutional Neural Network model to recognise images from CIFAR-10 dataset. 

There are reference links :
https://www.tensorflow.org/
https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Machine learning is about to build an algorithm or a functions that process input data and produce results based on given input data and historical information. We are using historical data to “teach” our function. During the learning phase we will provide training data and expected output for each data item. This approach is calling a supervisory machine learning. After the training is over our model can start recognise  an input data that it never “sees” before.

To build our model we need a tool and the best choice for us is Tensorflow platform. There are several reasons for this.  First of all Tensorflow is open source software and it means it’s free to use. Second - it provides end-to-end solution and we can build a model and deploy it on different architectures including WEB and Mobile. And the last but not least Tensorflow is supported by number of companies and you can check the list of them on the Tensorflow site.  There are some big names like Airbnb, Google and Coca Cola and we can find here number of case studies that help us to understand how to use Tensorflow in real business. 

You can imagine that Tensorflow is quite big library and in our case the high level API will help a lot. 

That is why we are going to start with Keras. Initially Keras was a separate library and it’s the best available API for Tensorflow. Starting from Tensorflow version 2.0 Keras is part of Tensorflow and we can start using it right away. Don’t need to import a separate library any more. Keras is much easier to use and it speeds up the building model process.

For our small project we are going to use local environment. Easiest way to setup it is using Anaconda.

ABV2YS9jbzE,"Feature Engineering | Applied Machine Learning, Part 1","Explore how to perform feature engineering, a technique for transforming raw data into features that are suitable for a machine learning algorithm. 

Feature engineering starts with your best guess about what features might influence the action you’re trying to predict. After that, it’s an iterative process where you create new features, add them to your model, and see if your results have improved.   

This video provides a high-level overview of the topic, and it uses several examples to illustrate basic principles behind feature engineering and established ways for extracting features from signals, text, and images.

Feature engineering refers to the process of selecting and designing relevant features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. It involves domain expertise and creativity to identify informative features that capture the underlying patterns in the data.

On the other hand, feature learning, also known as representation learning, is a technique that enables a machine learning model to automatically learn relevant features from raw data. It involves using neural networks to discover useful features that can be used for downstream tasks.

This video tutorial demonstrates that with enough knowledge, features can be engineered from images using handcrafted algorithms. However, the tutorial also shows that pre-trained networks such as VGG16, which were trained on large datasets, can automatically learn rich features from images with no prior knowledge. This illustrates the power of feature learning, where pre-trained models can be leveraged to extract informative features, making it a more efficient and effective method than feature engineering.

Hi, my name is Jose Hernandez and I am a data scientist.  In this course, you will learn about feature engineering.

Feature engineering involves adjusting and reworking the raw predictors you will use to represent a model to better uncover predictor-outcome relationships. This means you are in search of features that, in combination, will be the best representation of the sample data to answer a specific question. We will focus on tabular data, and in this context, feature engineering involves combining or decomposing information within existing features to create new ones. The engineering part of feature engineering means that you will be manually creating new columns in your data.

For example, you are given data on adult incomes and are tasked with building a model that adequately predicts whether an individual is below or above a specific salary range. To take a look at existing features, we can use the table() and glimpse() functions.

The modeling process will be iterative as you determine which features should be selected as inputs to your model. As you continue exploring your data, you may realize that some of your features are categories in the form of strings and can't be understood as inputs by the algorithm in their current form. The adult-underscore-incomes data contains raw features that are integers like age, and factors or character variables, like workclass.

Let's assume you are interested in using the workclass column from the adult-underscore-incomes dataset as a feature in a model that has the same two-class income levels as the target variable.

The workclass variable is a categorical string variable with eight classes, which correspond to the sector of a person's job.  Most statistical and machine learning models do not understand text inputs. If we want to use these categories as features, we need to encode them in a way that our model could understand.

In this course, we will be manipulating data using functions from the dplyr library.  Here, we will use the mutate() function to create a new column for each workclass category and the ifelse() function inside the mutate() function to specify the conditions for our new features. This is useful when you have a small number of categories to encode. For example, the mutate function will create a new column, new underscore workclass, of ones if the category is federal government and zero for everything else. We will see a full example of this on the next slide.

If you have a large number of categories, functions like dummyVars() from the caret library have automated this process. The function takes in a specific column or a whole data frame and creates a column for each category.

Since most machine learning and statistical models cannot interpret these groupings automatically, they have to be numerically encoded.  We can use one-hot encoding, a feature engineering technique in which we assign numerical values of zeros and ones to represent different categories in the string variable. In this case, we will create eight columns representing each category with a one if the category is present and a zero for other categories.

Now its your turn! Let's practice!

As a data scientist, you may need to:
- Highlight important information in the data 
- Remove/isolate unnecessary information (e.x.: outliers). 
- Add your own expertise and domain knowledge to alter the data. 

Feature engineering is an art of introducing new features that weren’t existing before. Data scientists spend 80% of their time performing feature engineering. The remaining 20% is the easy part which includes training the model and performing hyperparameters optimization. 

Performing proper feature engineering is crucial to improve AI/ML model performance.

As a data scientist, you need to answer the following questions:
- What are the capabilities of the ML model I have?
- Which features should I select?
- Can I add my domain knowledge to use less features?
- Can I come up with new features from the data I have at hand?
- What should I put in the missing data locations? 

It is important to choose features that are most relevant to the problem. 

Adding new features that are unnecessary will increase the computational requirements needed to train the model (curse of dimensionality).

There are numerous techniques that could be used to reduce the number of features (compress/encode the data) such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

Thanks.

NKakENiEaPs,Python Tutorial : Feature engineering and overfitting,"Want to learn more? Take the full course at https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/designing-machine-learning-workflows-in-python at your own pace. More than a video, you'll learn hands-on coding & quickly apply skills to your daily work.

---

Feature engineering uses domain knowledge and common sense to describe an object with numbers. Although adding more features can improve performance, it can also increase the risk of overfitting. In this lesson, you will learn more about this interesting trade-off.

Sometimes, the raw data can not fit into the form of a table. For example, consider electrocardiogram (or ECG) traces for a number of individuals. Each ECG trace is a time series, possibly of variable length, that cannot fit in one cell of a table. 

Instead, in the dataset shown here experts extracted over 250 one-dimensional numerical summaries from each ECG. These range from simple summaries like heart-rate to very complex properties of the signal with weird names like T-wave-amp, all of which can be useful in detecting a medical condition known as arrhythmia.

Even if the data are tabular, some of the columns might be non-numeric. Here is an example from the credit scoring dataset: the purpose of the loan takes values such as ""buy a new car"", ""education"" or ""retraining"". LabelEncoder will map these values onto a range of numbers.

But the classifier is then confused. It thinks that the categories have a natural ordering. For example, a decision tree might try to split the range in two. If it splits at 4, it is putting loans for business together with loans for a microwave oven!

A different approach is to use one-hot-encoding, implemented by the .get_dummies() pandas method. This creates one new dummy variable for each category, taking the value 1 for each example that falls in that category and 0 otherwise. You can see the first row of the data on the left, printed vertically for readability. No artificial ordering is introduced.

How about capturing semantic similarity? Notice that similar categories share keywords: for example, all consumer loans feature the keyword ""buy"". You can count common keywords using CountVectorizer from the feature_extraction module. 

First, replace underscores with spaces for easier tokenization. 

Then, apply the encoder using its .fit_transform() method. 

Finally, convert the resulting matrix to a DataFrame, naming the columns using the .get_feature_names() method of the CountVectorizer object.

Note that as we improve our feature engineering pipeline, the dimension of our DataFrame increases! The question arises: how many features is too many?

Well, with more columns, the algorithm has more opportunity to mistake coincidental patterns for real signal. We can test this by adding columns to the data containing purely random numbers totally unrelated to the class. As we add more columns on the horizontal axis, overfitting kicks in! Accuracy improves in-sample but deteriorates out-of-sample.

A popular solution is to add features freely, and then select the ""best"" ones using some feature selection technique. 

Let's try the trick from the previous slide, and augment the credit scoring dataset with 100 fake variables.

Then, we use the SelectKBest algorithm from the feature_selector module to select the 20 highest-scoring columns. We use the chi2 scoring method. The feature selector has a .fit() method to fit it to the data, and a .get_support() method that returns the index of the selected columns.

Thankfully, only a handful of fake columns remain in the selected features.

So remember this: every decision you make in your pipeline might affect other aspects of it, and in particular the risk of overfitting. The following exercises confirm this insight.

--- 
Welcome to Feature Engineering for NLP in Python! I am Rounak

and I will be your instructor for this course. In this course, you will learn to extract useful features out of text and convert them into formats that are suitable for machine learning algorithms.

 For any ML algorithm, data fed into it must be in tabular form and all the training features must be numerical.

Consider the Iris dataset. Every training instance has exactly four numerical features. The ML algorithm uses these four features to train and predict if an instance belongs to class iris-virginica, iris-setosa or iris-versicolor.

 ML algorithms can also work with categorical data provided they are converted into numerical form through one-hot encoding.

Let's say you have a categorical feature 'sex' with two categories 'male' and 'female'.

 One-hot encoding will convert this feature into two features,

 'sex_male' and 'sex_female' such that each male instance has a 'sex_male' value of 1 and 'sex_female' value of 0. For females, it is the vice versa.

 To do this in code, we use pandas' get_dummies() function. 

Let's import pandas using the alias pd. We can then pass our dataframe df into the pd.get_dummies() function and pass a list of features to be encoded as the columns argument. Not mentioning columns will lead pandas to automatically encode all non-numerical features. 

Finally, we overwrite the original dataframe with the encoded version by assigning the dataframe returned by get_dummies() back to df.

 Consider a movie reviews dataset.

This data cannot be utilized by any machine learning or ML algorithm. The training feature 'review' isn't numerical. Neither is it categorical to perform one-hot encoding on.

 We need to perform two steps to make this dataset suitable for ML. 

The first is to standardize the text. This involves steps like converting words to lowercase and their base form. For instance, 'Reduction' gets lowercased and then converted to its base form, reduce. We will cover these concepts in more detail in subsequent lessons.

 After preprocessing, the reviews are converted into a set of numerical training features through a process known as vectorization. After vectorization, our original review dataset gets converted

 into something like this. We will learn techniques to achieve this in later lessons.

 We can also extract certain basic features from text. It maybe useful to know the word count, character count and average word length of a particular text. 

While working with niche data such as tweets, it also maybe useful to know how many hashtags have been used in a tweet. This tweet by Silverado Records,for instance, uses two.

 So far, we have seen how to extract features out of an entire body of text. Some NLP applications may require you to extract features for individual words. For instance, you may want to do parts-of-speech tagging to know the different parts-of-speech present in your text as shown.

As an example, consider the sentence 'I have a dog'. POS tagging will label each word with its corresponding part-of-speech.

 You may also want to know perform named entity recognition to find out if a particular noun is referring to a person, organization or country.

For instance, consider the sentence ""Brian works at DataCamp"". Here, there are two nouns ""Brian"" and ""DataCamp"". Brian refers to a person whereas DataCamp refers to an organization.

 Therefore, broadly speaking, this course will teach you how to conduct text preprocessing, extract certain basic features, word features and convert documents into a set of numerical features (using a process known as vectorization).

 Great! Now, let's practice!

LUZGlS07YiY,Feature Engineering: An Apprentice’s Guide to the “Dark Art” of Machine Learning,"Deborah Diller Harris

https://www.pyohio.org/2019/presentations/91

What is feature engineering and why do we need it?  When is it applied? Is it an art or a science? Find out the answers to these questions and more as we explore different methods of feature engineering with practical examples provided. There are three main methods of feature engineering: adjusting raw features, combining raw features and decomposing raw features into usable subsets. We will use datasets to illustrate binning, encoding, binaries, summing, differencing, feature scaling, extraction, and the manipulation of date/time features.  Finally, we will explore the performance of a machine learning model before and after feature engineering is applied. As a postscript, current automated feature engineering tools for Python will be introduced.

Why is feature engineering considered the ""dark art"" of machine learning? Transforming raw data into a form that your machine learning algorithm can utilize seems mysterious and downright frightening! Bring your wizard hat and join me as this machine learning apprentice shares her personal book of feature engineering incantations.

FXokoJUhsLQ,How to Evaluate Your ML Models Effectively? | Evaluation Metrics in Machine Learning!,"🔥 In this video we refer to the evaluation metrics used in machine learning. Confusion matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score are the most popular metrics for classification tasks. We explain the difference of each metric on a single example, showing that accuracy is well suited for balanced datasets, while other three for imbalanced ones. In some specific cases, we may prefer recall over precision and vice versa, or we might want to have both high using F1-Score. 

Additionally, there are other important metrics like AUC and ROC. Metrics for unsupervised learning and regression tasks are different. These are more complex topics, which we will cover separately, so stay with us!

In this video, I go through the different types of binary classification metrics.   These include: accuracy, prevalence, confusion matrices, sensitivity (aka recall or true positive rate), specificity (aka true negative rate), precision (aka positive predictive value), F1 score, and the areas under the precision-recall curve and the receiver operating characteristic curve, that is: AUPRC and AUROC.   We close with how to implement these using the scikit-learn package in Python, going through a Jupyter notebook.

spvYjEWtX-o,ML Concepts -  Best Practices when using ML Regression Metrics,"On this weekly Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database,  Jie Liu, Data Scientist for Oracle Machine Learning, covered the best practices when using Machine Learning Regression metrics.  

The goal of a regression task is to build models based on features to predict a target quantity, that is, a numeric value. After a regression model is applied to a test set, the next step is to evaluate the model performance by checking the error between the regression output and the true value.  A certain set of metrics is often used to evaluate the regression model such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R squared, etc.  What are the differences among those metrics? How does one choose a metric correctly? How does the metric translate back to the business world? 

In this Session, Jie went through various regression metrics and addressed the questions above.  Moreover, he showed how to compute regression metrics in a scalable way using OML4Py.

The Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.

jyeNAByFL_A,Machine Learning Regression Models Metrics,"In this video, we will cover machine learning regression metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R squared). 

After we train machine learning models, we would like to assess the performance of the model by comparing model predictions to actual (True) values. 

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is obtained by calculating the absolute difference between the model predictions and the true (actual) values
MAE is a measure of the average magnitude of error generated by the regression model.

Mean Square Error (MSE) is very similar to the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) but instead of using absolute values, squares of the difference between the model predictions and the training dataset (true values) is being calculated.
MSE values are generally larger compared to the MAE since the residuals are being squared. 

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) represents the standard deviation of the residuals (i.e.: differences between the model predictions and the true values (training data)).
RMSE can be easily interpreted compared to MSE because RMSE units match the units of the output.  
RMSE provides an estimate of how large the residuals are being dispersed.

R-square or the coefficient of determination represents the proportion of variance (of y) that has been explained by the independent variables in the model. Best possible score is 1.0
If 𝑅2=0.8, this means that 80% of the increase in university admission is due to GRE score (assuming a simple linear regression model). 
It provides an indication of goodness of fit and therefore a measure of how well unseen samples are likely to be predicted by the model.
A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a R² score of 0.0.

Looking at the error rate of a machine learning model is not the only way to look at the performance of a model. For classification AI which are AI models that classify data according to data it has learned, a confusion matrix, also known as error matrix, is used to judge the performance of a machine. It is a way of visualizing the performance of a machine learning model.

In this video on What is a Confusion Matrix we show you what a confusion matrix looks like. Essentially, it has four quadrants. Across the top represents predictions of what the data is and across the side represents the actual data- the truth. The point of a confusion matrix is to observe the strengths and weaknesses of a model. Now imagine an AI that identifies pictures of dogs. 

Here is a visual of 15 images of dogs this AI model processed. Whatever is circled is the AI predictions of which images are dogs . Therefore, the accuracy of the model is 60%. It correctly identified 9 out of 15 images as dogs For machine learning, however, accuracy is not relied on because it does not tell you for AI models. It is just as important to know what the machine did correctly as what the machine light have missed. 

This is where the confusion matrix comes in. In the confusion matrix for the same dog classifier image recognition AI we take note of the total number of data points, which are 15. Then we start on the top left. Here we count how many images the model predicted were not dogs , that in fact were not dogs. Here you count three. These are your true negatives- a correct prediction 

Watch the rest of the video to find out the other three data points of how this confusion matrix model works.

In this video on the confusion matrix, we’ll dive deep into what a confusion matrix is. You'll learn how this essential tool helps summarize the performance of a classification model by comparing actual and predicted outcomes. We’ll also explore why confusion matrices are so important in evaluating and improving your models. Next, we’ll break down the parts of the confusion matrix—True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN). These elements are foundational to understanding your model’s strengths and weaknesses.We’ll also cover the confusion matrix metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide valuable insights into your model’s performance, helping you make informed decisions on model adjustments. Finally, we’ll bring it all together with a hands-on demo where you’ll see a confusion matrix in action with a real dataset. This practical example will help you understand how to implement and interpret confusion matrices in your projects.

✅ What is Type 1 and Type 2 error in confusion matrix?
A Type-1 error, also called a false positive, occurs when a correct null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. On the other hand, a Type-2 error, or false negative, happens when we fail to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false.

✅ What is TP FP TN FN?
A confusion matrix is a table that provides an overview of a classification model's performance by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels. It shows the counts of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) based on the model's predictions.

✅ What is the formula for confusion matrix?
accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) sensitivity, aka true positive rate = TP / (TP + FN) specificity, aka true negative rate = TN / (TN + FP) positive predictive value (PPV), aka precision = TP / (TP + FP)
