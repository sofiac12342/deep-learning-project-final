While it touches on the core concept of value estimation used in DQN, it remains a high-level historical and conceptual overview rather than a technical implementation guide.",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,zR11FLZ-O9M,deep_q_learning
31,"The speaker compares learning-based approaches (AlphaZero) with brute-force engines (Stockfish) and discusses the efficiency of search trees. This is broad contextual information about the field of RL, offering no specific details on implementing DQN.",2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,zR11FLZ-O9M,deep_q_learning
32,This segment focuses on the current state of RL in industry applications like autonomous driving and robotics. It serves as general industry context and contains no technical instruction regarding the target skill.,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,zR11FLZ-O9M,deep_q_learning
33,"Discusses the 'sim-to-real' gap and theoretical approaches to transfer learning (e.g., infinite simulations). While relevant to RL theory, it does not address the implementation of Deep Q-Networks.",2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,zR11FLZ-O9M,deep_q_learning
34,"Provides meta-advice on how to learn RL, recommending tools like OpenAI Gym and PyTorch, and suggesting students implement algorithms from scratch. It points to where the skill can be learned but does not teach the skill itself.",2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,zR11FLZ-O9M,deep_q_learning
35,Consists of career advice for researchers on how to publish papers and closing remarks for the lecture. It is off-topic regarding the technical implementation of DQN.,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,zR11FLZ-O9M,deep_q_learning
0,"Introduces the general architecture of web apps (frontend, backend, database) and mentions Flask as a Python backend framework. However, it stays at a high conceptual level and does not provide specific instruction on using Flask.",2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,zhgRFBWa6bk,model_deployment_api
1,"Focuses primarily on Streamlit (a frontend tool) and visual examples of dashboards. While it mentions model serialization briefly, the bulk of the content is about avoiding backend development, which is tangential to the goal of learning Flask/FastAPI deployment.",2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,zhgRFBWa6bk,model_deployment_api
2,"Explains core concepts of the target skill: REST APIs, HTTP requests, and endpoints. However, instead of teaching how to implement these with Flask/FastAPI, it introduces MLflow as a tool to automate this process. It provides good conceptual background (Relevance 3) but deviates from the specific framework implementation requested.",3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,zhgRFBWa6bk,model_deployment_api
3,"Discusses model logging, the 'mlflow serve' command, and creating Docker images via MLflow. While it addresses 'deployment' and 'containerization' (mentioned in the skill description), it uses a specific automation tool (MLflow) rather than teaching the manual Flask/Docker setup implied by the skill name.",2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,zhgRFBWa6bk,model_deployment_api
4,Describes the architecture of connecting the frontend to the backend services. It is a high-level overview of the specific project structure rather than a tutorial on the deployment frameworks.,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,zhgRFBWa6bk,model_deployment_api
5,Demonstrates the user interface of the final application (Streamlit dashboard). This is a frontend demo and does not contain technical details relevant to backend model deployment.,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,zhgRFBWa6bk,model_deployment_api
6,Closing remarks and outro. Contains no educational content.,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,zhgRFBWa6bk,model_deployment_api
