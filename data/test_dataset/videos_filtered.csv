EUrWGTCGzlA,Deep Q-Learning/Deep Q-Network (DQN) Explained | Python Pytorch Deep Reinforcement Learning,"This tutorial contains step by step explanation, code walkthru, and demo of how Deep Q-Learning (DQL) works. We'll use DQL to solve the very simple Gymnasium FrozenLake-v1 Reinforcement Learning environment. We'll cover the differences between Q-Learning vs DQL, the Epsilon-Greedy Policy, the Policy Deep Q-Network (DQN), the Target DQN, and Experience Replay. After this video, you will understand DQL.

cO5g5qLrLSo,Deep Reinforcement Learning Tutorial for Python in 20 Minutes,"Worked with supervised learning?

Maybe you’ve dabbled with unsupervised learning. 

But what about reinforcement learning?

It can be a little tricky to get all setup with RL. You need to manage environments, build your DL models and work out how to save your models down so you can reuse them. But that shouldn’t stop you! 

Why?

Because they’re powering the next generation of advancements in IOT environments and even gaming and the use cases for RL are growing by the minute. That being said, getting started doesn’t need to be a pain, you can get up and running in just 20 minutes working with Keras-RL and OpenAI. 

In this video you’ll learn how to:
1. Create OpenAI Gym environments like CartPole
2. Build a Deep Learning model for Reinforcement Learning using Tensorflow and Keras
3. Train a Reinforcement Learning model using Deep Q Policy based learning using Keras-RL

kjW3Ba4hTYI,Dueling Deep Q Learning is Simple in PyTorch,"Let's code a dueling deep q learning agent to beat the lunar lander environment. Dueling Deep Q learning is pretty cool in that it splits the Q network into a value function and an advantage function. This unique twist on the algorithm provides a significant improvement in convergence speed in the lunar lander environment from the OpenAI gym.

Dueling Deep networks can also be incorporated into double deep q learning, or really any variant of deep Q learning as the only real change is the splitting of the Q function into a value and an advantage stream.

Gym by OpenAI is an open source interface to reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. It comes with a set of standard tasks useful for benchmarking RL algorithms (CartPole, Pendulum, Walking Humanoid, etc.), and an easy, standardized way to create a learning environment for a research problem. Stable Baselines 3 provides a set of reliable, rigorously tested PyTorch implementations of popular Deep RL algorithms to facilitate results replication. Together they can be used for fast and easy RL benchmarks and prototyping.

Through training in our new simulated hide-and-seek environment, agents build a series of six distinct strategies and counterstrategies, some of which we did not know our environment supported. The self-supervised emergent complexity in this simple environment further suggests that multi-agent co-adaptation may one day produce extremely complex and intelligent behavior.

hvm13n3xVHY,🚀 Learn how to Apply DQN Reinforcement Learning to Agents -  AutoCodeAgent v1.8.0 - with Meta RL Rag,"In this video, we're excited to unveil AutoCodeAgent v1.8.0!

🐙 🐙 🐙 GitHub Repository: https://github.com/samugit83/AutoCodeAgent2.0

🔥✨ What's New in Version 1.8.0 🔥✨

🚀 Dual-Mode Reinforcement Learning Agent:

Introduced a powerful and versatile Q-Learning agent that learns optimal policies directly from experience.

Offers two distinct operational modes:

🧮 Simple Mode (Tabular Q-Learning): Ideal for small, discrete problems, this mode stores state-action values in a traditional Q-table.

🧠 Neural Mode (Deep Q-Network - DQN): Harnesses a neural network to approximate Q-values, enabling advanced learning in complex, continuous state spaces.

Seamlessly integrates with Redis and WebSockets, allowing for potential real-time human feedback to enhance policy refinement, especially beneficial for the DQN approach.

🎯 RL-Powered Dynamic RAG Selection (RL Meta RAG):

Launched the innovative RL Meta RAG system that dynamically selects the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique—including LlamaIndex, HyDE, and Adaptive RAG—based on query-specific characteristics.

Utilizes an advanced language model (LLM) to analyze and extract query features, such as complexity, domain, and ambiguity, guiding the RL agent's decision-making process.

Features a robust mechanism to alternate intelligently between RL-driven decisions and direct LLM suggestions, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.

MI8ByADMh20,Q Learning simply explained | SARSA and Q-Learning Explanation,"This problem is from a book called Reinforcement Learning: In Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. I found this problem to be a good way to introduce SARSA and Q-Learning. I am not an expert in reinforcement learning, but I find these kind of ideas interesting. I thought it would be cool to explore reinforcement learning and make a video explaining a concept to the best of my ability. I will be making more videos about reinforcement learning in the future and hopefully my explanations get better as time goes on. 

Credits:
I used Manim for the animations. 

All of the information on reinforcement learning came from the RL book by Sutton and Barto. I didn't explain the concepts well enough in the video to do the book justice. The book is very well written.

The environment is from AIGym.

J1XCWjuyRaI,How to Code RL Agents Like DeepMind,"DeepMind is known for leading the way in deep reinforcement learning research. Creating novel agents to conquer the most advanced environments requires the use of some sophisticated infrastructure. Fortunately for us mere mortals, they've open sourced their framework for designing deep reinforcement learning agents: ACME. 

In ACME, you'll find everything from deep Q learning all the way up to the R2D2 algorithm. Better yet, it includes all the building blocks to start creating your own custom agents. 

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to setup ACME and get started making our own deep Q learning and deep deterministic policy gradient agent.

UbCWoMf80PY,Deploy Machine Learning Model using Flask,"Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[3] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.

i3RMlrx4ol4,deploy machine learning model flask  | on web page | full tutorial | step by step,"In this video i have created a awesome machine learning model deployed website. With basic iris flower dataset.
I have covered all basic points which you should know to use flask like:
__name__
__main__
app.route
app.run
and much more stuff.
we have deployed our machine learning model with the help of flask framework. and I tried making everything look easier and generalised in a way that even if you have your own different model then also you can follow this video in order to deploy your model also on the web.
Using flask we can create html pages which can use python code indirectly also with jinja you can do so many python type stuff within html itself.

Please do let me know if you have any queries I will try my best to solve your queries.

-l7YocEQtA0,Docker Simply Explained with a Machine Learning Project for Beginners,"Today we will finally learn how to work with Docker! 🐋🐋🐋
We will focus on understanding the concept of containers, images and Dockerfiles in simple terms with lots of helpful visualizations and hands-on examples! We will focus on the logic behind each Docker component, not only in terms of how it works - but also what problems does it solve and what happens if we do not use it! 🤓
Codewise, will see a step by step workflow of developing an incredibly simple Machine Learning program using the Huggingface Transformers library. We will build our own custom Docker image based on the Jupyter Tensorflow Notebook one. And we will even learn how to deploy our finished project to DokcerHub! 🚀🚀🚀
By the end of this video - you will have your very own video captions translating software as well as a comprehensive understanding of Docker (regardless of your level of experience with programming).

JigSpm6KORI,How to Convert your Machine learning Model into a Docker Image (Python ML Model),"In this tutorial, I'll show you how to convert your machine learning model written in Python into a Docker image. Docker is a platform that allows you to package your application and all its dependencies into a single container, making it easy to deploy and run your application in a variety of environments.

To get started, we'll assume that you have already developed a machine learning model using Python and that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. We'll use Docker to create an image of our model and then run it in a container.",Ammar Jamshed (Data Alchemist),2023-04-17T20:21:23Z,PT8M27S,14481,150,12,en,en,2025-11-07-static-v1,507
mUnrWn6flfc,Build and Run a Docker Container for your Machine Learning Model (Step by Step),"This video tutorial I will talk about how to dockerize Machine Learning (ML) model and will help you to build your first #Docker image and run a Docker container for your Machine Learning project, supposing you are a Data Scientist, Machine Learning (ML) Engineer or aspiring to become a Master of Data Science. This lesson extends your data science knowledge by touching Docker from a Machine Learning perspective. At the end of this Docker lesson you will be able to:
1. Create your Docker image
2. Run your Docker container in the Docker Dashboard tool.
3. Improve your Docker image with your customized working directory.
4. Make your Docker image more stable by using Environmental variables, which could be integrated across the Python codes and the Docker Image itself.

Building-up Docker Images and Docker containers are very important skills for Data Scientists, Developers, and Machine Learning Engineerings who work with Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) tasks.

Pay special attention on how to correctly build a simple #Dockerfile and what main parts must be defined there. How to use COPY, RUN, and other standard functions there, and also how to use default terminal functions inside Dockerfile. This is very important. 
Also, it can be highlighted that in this example I used a scipy-notebook image as the base image to build a Docker container, and then a standard jovyan notebook user for our image. You can read more about jovyan here: https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/what-is-with-the-weird-jovyan-user/1673

In order to start building a Docker container for a Machine Learning model, let’s have three files: Dockerfile, train.py, inference.py.
I highly recommend to download project files and Docker Dashboard tool while following the steps introduced in the video:
- Download all project files from Github here: https://github.com/xaviervasques/EEG-letters
- Download the Docker Dashboard (for both Windows or Mac) Tool: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
This tool allows you to push your Docker Containers into DockerHub, share it to the Public and explore your Docker images within user friendly interface.

The content of the Docker lesson:
0:00 Introducing lessons, requirements to complete it
1:14 Your first Docker image. Main commands and Python project codes
6:05 Improve Docker Image with default working directory (WORKDIR)
9:23 Make your Docker Image with Environmental Variables
16:19 Conclusions

In this example I am using the Mac operating system and use simple terminal functions within it.

So, all in all, within this tutorial you will create three different Docker images with containers and will run all of them separately, by integrating two Machine Learning models (Linear Discriminant Analysis - LDA, and Neural Networks - NN) into them. I tried to make this tutorial as clean as possible. If you have any questions, drop a comment below.

GOgfQxDPaDw,The Easiest Ways to Run LLMs Locally - Docker Model Runner Tutorial,"Download Docker Desktop: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
Docker Model Runner Docs: https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/

There's now an even easier way to run AI models locally other than using Ollama. Now Docker just released their model runner and this is a complete game changer for running models locally. Now, just like Ollama, you can manage, run and deploy models locally with OpenAI compliant API. And all of this is built right into Docker desktop.

DevLaunch is my mentorship program where I personally help developers go beyond tutorials, build real-world projects, and actually land jobs. No fluff. Just real accountability, proven strategies, and hands-on guidance. Learn more here - https://training.devlaunch.us/tim?video=5QrYoTeMtu4

SpirD-FhxQI,Introduction to Scikit-Learn pipeline API,"#datascience #machinelearning #ml

Scikit-learn Pipeline can be used to chain multiple estimators into one. This is useful as there is often a fixed sequence of steps in processing the data, for example feature selection, normalization and classification. Pipeline serves multiple purposes here:

Convenience and encapsulation
You only have to call fit and predict once on your data to fit a whole sequence of estimators.

Joint parameter selection
You can grid search over parameters of all estimators in the pipeline at once.

Safety
Pipelines help avoid leaking statistics from your test data into the trained model in cross-validation, by ensuring that the same samples are used to train the transformers and predictors.

All estimators in a pipeline, except the last one, must be transformers (i.e. must have a transform method). The last estimator may be any type (transformer, classifier, etc.).

CPuyUvnqEi4,FastAPI and scikit-learn tutorial to create an API to serve a random forest classifier,"The video tutorial covers the process of creating an API using FastAPI that serves a machine learning model built with Scikit-learn. The instructor demonstrates how to create a Random Forest Classifier to classify the Iris dataset. The tutorial includes instructions for setting up the environment, fetching the dataset from Kaggle, exploratory data analysis, model training, and exporting the trained model. The tutorial then transitions to developing a FastAPI backend which loads the model and provides an API endpoint for predictions. The endpoint is tested using both the built-in FastAPI docs and the HTTPX library in Python.

AwjeRg1u5VI,Rajat Arya - Deploying scikit learn Models in Production,"PyData Dallas 2015
Machine Learning should be everywhere. Applications today have the opportunity to leverage all the data being collected about users' interactions and behavior. Unfortunately machine learning at scale is mostly absent from production systems. Training models using scikit-learn is useful, but it is difficult to take this code to production. Why is it so painful to deploy models in a scalable way? What are the options and what challenges exist today? After exploring the current options, I will present Dato Predictive Services, which we developed to address these challenges. Dato Predictive Services enables deploying and managing scikit-learn models into an elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant, low-latency cluster of machines, in AWS & YARN. With Dato Predictive Services, in one command, you can take arbitrary Python and deploy it as a REST service.

This will be a hands-on talk, walking through code and with multiple demonstrations. Bring your laptop to follow along!

How to Hit an API Endpoint with a sklearn Model: A Step-by-Step Guide

Working with machine learning models often requires us to deploy our trained models in a way that they can be easily accessed for predictions. In this post, we will dive into how to hit an API endpoint using a sklearn model and the Flask web framework. If you’ve been facing challenges setting this up or encountered errors in the process, don’t worry! We have a clear roadmap here.

The Problem: Setting Up the API Endpoint

You may have successfully trained a model (e.g., using KMeans clustering with the Iris dataset), saved it via pickle, and now you want to create an API endpoint to make predictions. However, you encounter some issues while trying to run the Flask app to serve those predictions.

Here’s a quick recap of what you've done so far:

Model Training: You trained a KMeans model and saved it as a pickle file.

API Development: You created a Flask API with a /predict route to handle incoming prediction requests.

Errors Encountered: Running the Flask app results in errors related to the server not being able to find the specified route.

Solution Breakdown: Step-by-Step

1. Fixing the API Server

One of the issues you encountered was caused by running Flask with debug=True. This option is intended for development but can lead to unwanted restarts, particularly in Jupyter Notebook (IPython) environments.

Solution: Disable the reloader using the use_reloader option:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

This stops Flask from reloading the app every time you make a change, which can improve stability during testing.

2. Properly Loading the Pickled Model

You correctly load your KMeans model with the following lines:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

Make sure the path to your pickle file is correct and that the file is accessible. The error handling will help you catch any issues that arise during its loading.

3. Making the Prediction

With your API running and the model loaded, the next step is to process incoming requests. Here’s how you handle incoming JSON data in your /predict route:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

Ensure the incoming JSON matches the feature set that your KMeans model expects (in this case, the features derived from the Iris dataset).

4. Testing Your API Endpoint

After you've made the adjustments, you can test the API. Open a web browser and enter:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

Upon accessing this route directly, you should receive a “Not Found” message since it expects a POST request with JSON data.

To test the predictions:

Use a tool like Postman or cURL to send a JSON request to http://localhost:8000/predict.

5. Working with Environment Variables

The last point of confusion was about using the export command to set environment variables for Flask. These commands should be run in your command line/terminal, not included in your Python script like so:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

These commands initialize your Flask application and enable debugging when running from the console.

Conclusion

Using Flask to expose your sklearn models via an API endpoint can initially seem tricky, but with the right adjustments, you can seamlessly integrate these systems. We've gone through how to solve common issues encountered when setting up your API, including disabling the reloader, loading models, handling predictions correctly, testing your endpoint efficiently, and knowing how to configure environment variables.

If you're looking to broaden your understanding of deploying machine learning models, using Flask is an excellent choice. Happy coding, and may your models serve ac",vlogize,2025-09-30T01:18:14Z,PT2M5S,1,0,0,en-US,en-US,2025-11-07-static-v1,125

Create a deployable machine learning pipeline with all the basic step! Curious what those steps are? You’ve come to the write place.  I've went ahead and documented the most important steps when deploying a machine learning model for user experience!

This is a comprehensive guide on what and why you should develop microservices and pipelines! Everything is slowly being automated, and you should definitely be familiar with these methods in the data science world!

Docker, PostgreSQL, Flask, Python, and HTML are used in my microservices. Of course, you DO NOT need to be an expert in any of these languages. Best way to learn is by doing!!!
